# Talent-Marketplace
This research investigates how to optimally assign U.S. Marine Corps (USMC)  officers to billets. Currently, the USMC relies on monitors to manually develop the  assignment solution based on limited information. This leaves the USMC with a  suboptimal use of its resources, and with officers whose human capital is not fully  developed or who consider attrition. The research shows essential features of a  marketplace from other military branches. Emphasis is placed on those features directly  related to meeting the billet requirements, the preferences of Marines and Marines’ career  paths. This marketplace system requires a substantial amount of information from billet  owners, monitors, and officers. Data from a subset of the aviation community were  collected and processed to develop optimization models that balance two goals:  permanent change of station cost, and Marines’ priorities. The models are amenable to  extensions that consider additional goals and requirements, as data become available.  Experimentation shows insightful tradeoffs in the two objectives and provides efficient  solutions, which are useful in presenting alternatives.
